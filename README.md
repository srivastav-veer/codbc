CODBC :: An Introduction to API for Pro*C
=========================================

`CODBC` is an _open source `C++` API for `Pro*C`_. If you try to connect _`C++` with `Oracle SQL`_ then you have two options, `OCCI` or `Pro*C`. `OCCI` is the best that anyone would recommend, even I would also recommend you to go for `OCCI`, it has all the required built-in classes and functions that would make your product the best and robust.

Now let me tell you about `Pro*c`, `Pro*C` is the oldest way through which you can connect your `C++` code with `Oracle SQL`. `OCCI` was introduced with `Oracle 9i`, but `Pro*C` has been there long before that. Well, there is not much support over internet for `Pro*c` as much as you can find for `OCCI` or any other tool or API for `C++` and Oracle Connection. `Pro*C` has a complete different approach towards making this bridge between Oracle SQL and C++. I will talk later about `Pro*C` methods and technologies. Well by now, you are aware that you have two good options to connect `C++` and Oracle, `Pro*C` and `OCCI`.

###Why to use Pro*C###
By reading the above information you would think **Why to use Pro*C when we have OCCI?**. True, you can use `OCCI`, I would even suggest you to that. But, let me remind you, **"_`OCCI` was introduced with `Oracle 9i`_"**; Now imagine what was before? Yes, it was Pro*C. _Any technology or method never dies_.

Why are we using Pro*C? - The reason is more financial than technical, actually there are some systems which still use Pro*C. Actually, these systems were installed along with the foundation of complete Information Technology Industries; And the cost of migrating or upgrading these systems are much high than maintaining these systems. These systems are known as Legacy Systems. Pro*C is mainly used with Legacy Systems. Most of the IT industries provide support to such legacy systems, and there they require Pro*C.
